ESL Level 4 Grammar Guide
Welcome to the ESL Level 4 Grammar Guide. This document serves as a comprehensive overview of the essential grammar topics covered in this level. Each section corresponds to a specific lesson, providing clear explanations, structural breakdowns, and practical examples drawn from the curriculum. The goal is to build your confidence and help you establish a strong foundation in English grammar, preparing you for more complex communication.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0 Lesson 1: Asking and Answering about Preferences
This lesson focuses on the fundamental skill of expressing likes and dislikes. Learning how to ask and answer questions about preferences is strategically important for engaging in everyday conversation, sharing personal opinions, and building connections with others.
1.2 Grammar Focus: Wh- Questions and Adjectives
To ask about someone's favorite or least favorite things, you can use simple question structures with "What's...?" and "Why?". Answers often include descriptive adjectives to explain the reason behind the preference. These adjectives can be positive (to describe something you like) or negative (to describe something you dislike).
Positive Adjective
	Negative Adjective
	amazing
	terrible
	easy
	difficult
	interesting
	boring
	good
	bad
	Examples
Here are some examples of questions and answers about preferences:
* What's your least favorite subject?
   * My least favorite subject is math.
* What's your favorite subject?
   * My favorite subject is history.
* Why?
   * Because it's boring.
* You can also combine these ideas into a single sentence: My favorite subject is English, because it's amazing.
Mastering these questions and answers is a great start. Now that you can share your opinions about the present, let's learn how to describe actions and events that happened in the past using the Simple Past Tense.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.0 Lesson 2: The Simple Past Tense
The Simple Past Tense is crucial for narrating past events, telling stories, and discussing experiences. Mastering this tense is a cornerstone of English communication, allowing you to clearly sequence actions that have already occurred.
2.2 Grammar Focus: Regular and Irregular Verbs
In the Simple Past Tense, verbs are categorized as either regular or irregular.
* Regular verbs follow a standard pattern and end in -ed.
* Irregular verbs do not follow a pattern and have unique past tense forms that must be memorized.
Past Simple Verb Forms
Base Verb
	Past Simple Form
	bake
	baked
	play
	played
	call
	called
	watch
	watched
	take
	took
	eat
	ate
	drink
	drank
	read
	read
	2.3 Grammar Focus: Forming Questions with 'did'
To ask questions about actions in the past, use the auxiliary verb 'did'. The structure is: What did + subject + do + time phrase?
Notice that the main verb ("do") remains in its base form.
Examples
* What did you do yesterday?
* What did we do last week?
Answers to these questions are complete sentences in the simple past, like this example from the lesson: I drank a milkshake.
Now that we have covered how to describe past actions, the next lesson will focus on using the verb 'to be' to describe past states and conditions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.0 Lesson 3: The Verb 'to be' in the Past (Was / Were)
Mastering the past tense of the verb 'to be' (was and were) is essential for describing states, conditions, locations, and feelings in the past. Unlike the action verbs covered in the previous lesson, was and were help paint a picture of how things were.
3.2 Grammar Focus: Conjugation and Usage
The correct form of 'to be' in the past depends on the subject of the sentence.
Subject
	Past Simple Form
	I
	was
	He / She / It
	was
	You / They/ We
	were
	3.3 Grammar Focus: Forming Questions and Statements
To form questions, the verb (was/were) often comes before the subject. Statements can be affirmative (positive) or negative (using wasn't or weren't).
Examples
Here are examples of questions, statements, and short answers using was and were.
* Questions:
   * How were the games?
   * Who was at the birthday party?
   * Was the birthday cake amazing?
* Statements:
   * It was amazing.
   * They were fun.
   * My friends were at the birthday party.
* Short Answers:
   * No, it wasn't.
   * Yes, it was.
With a solid understanding of the simple past, we can now learn how to connect past events into more complex and descriptive sentences.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.0 Lesson 4: Compound Sentences in the Past
Compound sentences allow you to combine related ideas into a single, more fluid statement. Using conjunctions like 'and' is an effective way to provide more detail and improve the flow of your storytelling when recounting past events.
4.2 Grammar Focus: Using 'and' to Connect Clauses
You can join two related simple past sentences to form one compound sentence. Simply replace the period at the end of the first sentence with the conjunction 'and'.
Examples
* Separate: I went to the theme park. I rode the roller coaster.
* Combined: I went to the theme park and rode the roller coaster.
Here are more examples of combined sentences:
* I went to the museum and looked at beautiful paintings.
* I went to the beach and had a barbeque with my family.
* I went to the shopping centre and bought some new clothes.
From describing what you did in the past, we will now shift to a new function: giving advice about what someone should do in the present.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.0 Lesson 5: Giving Advice with 'Should'
Using modal verbs like 'should' is essential for giving polite advice and making suggestions. This is a common and important function in both social and professional interactions, allowing you to help others or recommend a course of action.
5.2 Grammar Focus: 'Should' for Recommendations
The structure for giving advice is simple and consistent: You should + [base form of verb]. It is important to remember that the main verb after 'should' does not change, regardless of the subject.
Examples
This table shows common problems and the corresponding advice using 'should'.
Problem
	Advice
	I have a headache.
	You should drink some water.
	I have a toothache.
	You should visit a dentist.
	I have a fever.
	You should get some rest.
	I have a sore throat.
	You should take some medicine.
	5.3 Grammar Focus: Conditional Advice with 'If'
To make your advice more specific, you can use an 'if' clause to state the condition. This structure clarifies that the advice applies to a particular situation. The formula is: If you have [a condition], you should [give advice].
Example
* If you have a headache, you should drink water.
After learning how to give advice, we will explore how to ask for specific information using a variety of essential question words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.0 Lesson 6: Forming Questions with Wh- Words
The "Wh-" question words are the building blocks for seeking specific information. Mastering their use is critical for clear communication, as they allow you to ask for details about people, places, things, times, reasons, and methods.
6.2 Grammar Focus: Understanding Wh- Words
Each question word has a specific meaning and is used to ask about a particular type of information.
Question Word
	Meaning/Use
	Where
	place
	Who
	person or people
	What
	object or thing
	When
	time
	Why
	reason
	How
	more information
	6.3 Examples
Here are several examples of complete questions using different Wh- words:
* What's your favorite subject?
* Who was at the birthday party?
* How were the games?
* Where did you go?
From the broad topic of question formation, we will now narrow our focus to a specific grammatical rule: using the correct articles before nouns.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.0 Lesson 7: Indefinite Articles (a / an)
The indefinite articles 'a' and 'an' are fundamental for constructing grammatically correct sentences. They are used to refer to a single, non-specific person, place, or thing. Choosing the correct article depends on the sound of the word that follows it.
7.2 Grammar Focus: The Rule of Vowel Sounds
The core rule for using indefinite articles is based on pronunciation, not spelling:
* Use 'a' before words that begin with a consonant sound.
* Use 'an' before words that begin with a vowel sound (a, e, i, o, u).
For example, the incorrect sentence There's a amazing whales. contains two mistakes. The correction, There's an amazing whale., fixes both:
1. 'an' is used because "amazing" begins with a vowel sound.
2. The singular noun 'whale' is used because the article refers to a single item.
7.3 Examples
Here are examples demonstrating the correct usage of both 'a' and 'an':
* There's a turtle.
* We saw a small otter.
* There's an eel.
* There is an octopus.
* There's an amazing whale.
After learning how to identify single items with articles, the next lesson will teach you how to classify and quantify nouns as either countable or uncountable.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.0 Lesson 8: Countable and Uncountable Nouns
A key distinction in English grammar is between countable and uncountable nouns. Countable nouns are things you can count individually (e.g., eggs, bananas), while uncountable nouns are things that cannot be counted as separate units (e.g., sugar, flour). Understanding this difference is essential for using the correct quantifiers and forming proper questions about quantity.
8.2 Grammar Focus: 'How much?' vs. 'How many?'
The question you use to ask about quantity depends on whether the noun is countable or uncountable.
* Use "How many?" with plural countable nouns.
* Use "How much?" with uncountable nouns.
Asking About Quantity
Use 'How many?' with Countable Nouns
	Use 'How much?' with Uncountable Nouns
	How many eggs do you need?
	How much sugar do you need?
	How many chocolate bars do you need?
	How much jam do you need?
	How many nuts do you need?
	How much butter do you need?
	8.3 Grammar Focus: Quantifiers for Uncountable Nouns
While uncountable nouns cannot be counted directly, they can be measured or contained in units. To quantify them, we use container or unit words.
* a bag of sugar
* a jar of jam
* a bottle of oil
* a block of butter
Moving from quantifying ingredients, we will now focus on describing people by their jobs and professions using the Simple Present tense.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.0 Lesson 9: Simple Present for Professions
The Simple Present tense is used to state facts, describe habits, and talk about routines. One of its most important functions is to describe a person's profession or job, as this is considered a long-term fact.
9.2 Grammar Focus: Subject-Verb Agreement
When asking about professions, subject-verb agreement is critical.
* For third-person singular subjects (He/She/It), use the auxiliary verb 'does'.
   * What does she do?
* For other subjects (They/You/We), use the auxiliary verb 'do'.
   * What do they do?
When stating a profession, use the correct form of the verb 'to be' (is/are) followed by an article (a/an).
* She is a lawyer.
* He is a dentist.
9.3 Examples
Here are common question-and-answer patterns for discussing professions:
* What does she do?
* What do they do?
* What does he do? He's a chef.
From talking about what people do, we will transition to talking about what people have by learning how to express possession.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.0 Lesson 10: Expressing Possession
Expressing possession is a fundamental part of communication. Possessives are essential for identifying who things belong to, clarifying relationships, and describing the world around us with precision.
10.2 Grammar Focus: The Possessive 's'
The most common way to show that a person owns something is to add an apostrophe + 's' ('s) to a singular noun (the owner).
Examples
* This is my grandma's perfume.
* This is my father's watch.
10.3 Grammar Focus: Asking with 'Whose'
To form questions about ownership, use the question word "Whose". This word specifically asks to identify the owner of an item.
Examples
* Whose necklace is it?
* Whose sunglasses are these?
After focusing on singular possession, we will broaden our scope to identify and count multiple items using plural nouns.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11.0 Lesson 11: Plural Nouns and 'There are'
The ability to form plural nouns is a fundamental skill for describing any environment. Plurals allow you to count and identify multiple objects, which is essential for giving detailed descriptions of places like a zoo, a museum, or a city.
11.2 Grammar Focus: Forming Plurals
The most basic rule for forming plurals in English is to add '-s' to the end of a singular noun.
Examples
* snakes
* paintings
* fountains
* tickets
* sharks
11.3 Grammar Focus: Using 'There are'
To state the existence and quantity of multiple items, use the structure: There are + [number] + [plural noun].
Examples
* There are four giraffes at the zoo.
* There are six sculptures at the museum.
* There are five seagulls at the beach.
This lesson on plurals concludes our introduction of new topics. The final section will serve as a comprehensive review of all the key grammar points covered in Level 4.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
